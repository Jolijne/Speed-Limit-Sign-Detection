# Speed-Limit-Sign-Detection
Using python to create a system that can detect speed limit signs and identify the speed limit

Ritsumeikan University PBL: E-Society Lab Year 3

Python code with:
1. OpenCV
2. pytesseract
3. tesseract library for character recognition (Speed Limit Number)
4. applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
  
The Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is not perfect in this code. 
The speed limit detection works fine but the speed limit number recognition will only work under suitable conditions of quality image, proper lightning ...etc. 

The speed limit sign number recognition does not work 100% of the time. 
It misses when the condition is not ideal for the recognition to perform.
